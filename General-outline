# General outline of the steps you can follow to update content on a ceew.in:

1. Log in to the Drupal administration dashboard using your username and password.

2. Navigate to the content you want to update. This can be done by clicking on the "Content" link in the dashboard menu, or by searching for the content using the search bar.

3. Click on the title of the content you want to edit. This will open the content in edit mode.

4. Make your desired changes to the content.

5. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the "Save" button to publish your changes.

## Here are a few additional tips for updating content on a Ceew website:

- Be sure to proofread your changes carefully before publishing them.
- If you are making significant changes to the content, you may want to consider setting it to "unpublished" while you work on it, and then publishing it once you have finished your updates. This will prevent the changes from being visible to website visitors until they are ready.
